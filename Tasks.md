# TASKS.md — Meta Overview

Task tracking is now split per subsystem:

- `backend/Tasks.md` – API, runner, compute, testing instructions (Docker-first workflow).
- `frontend/Tasks.md` – Mantine UI, dashboard features, client-side testing notes.

Use this file only as an index. Always follow the Docker-based test/debug cycle described in the respective subproject file when verifying changes.
